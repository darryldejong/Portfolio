## Portfolio Darryl de Jong 🦤
### This is a website I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show my skills, projects, and contact info. You can learn more about what I do and check out some of the work I've done as an IT student.

### Visit my website here: [darryldejong.github.io](https://darryldejong.github.io/) 
(The website has a responsive design and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.)

#### For the website, I used:
- FontAwesome and Devicons for the icons
- Particles.js for a dynamic background
- Google Fonts for the text style
- DeviantArt for images and sprites
  
#### Disclaimer
The images used in this project are owned by their respective artists. All rights are reserved. If you're the owner of an image and wish to have it removed or modified, please contact me.

Thank you to the artists for providing these sprites and for their generous permission to use them. 🐮
