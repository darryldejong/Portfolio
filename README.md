## Portfolio Darryl de Jong ü¶§
### This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices to showcase my skills as an IT student.

#### For the website, I used:
- FontAwesome and Devicons for the icons
- Particles.js for a dynamic background
- Google Fonts for the text style
- DeviantArt for images and sprites

Thank you to the artists for providing these sprites and for their generous permission to use them. üêÆ
